A Genetic Algorithm(GA) is a stochastic search algorithm inspired by the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin. GA relies on the principle of natural selection, where only the
fittest individuals are selected for breeding in order to produce offspring for another generation. The algorithm selects a group of individuals to form a population which would produce solutions. Each step in the GA performs selection of individuals randomly, from the current population and consider them as parents for the reproduction process. Over subsequent generations the population gradually “evolves” towards an optimum solution. This makes GA an effective optimization mechanism. The relationship between optimization and Machine Learning(ML) is amongst the most significant advances in modern computer sciences. The optimization techniques and methods involved are proving crucial in the design of algorithms for the abstraction of critical information from large volumes of data. The ML optimization process is termed Meta-parameter (or Hyper-parameter) tuning and is considered vital for the overall success of Machine Learning models. Genetic algorithms can provide an effective technique for ML meta-parameter tuning. The aim of this research is to design a program for optimizing the Machine Learning model using the Genetic Algorithm, where part of the reproduction method is expanded by the implementation of vectorization properties. Later, the effectiveness of the proposed model is contrasted to the widely used optimization techniquesGrid Search and Randomized Search.
